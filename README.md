# PerfectScore
My final project for the Web Programming course given by SAP @ Sofia University FMI 2024.

Created using pure HTML, CSS & JavaScript. No database used, only localStorage.

Website Logo and Banner created by me :)

Perfect Score is a game review website. Anyone can create and manage an account, review existing games, impact the games' ratings with their reviews, comment on other users' reviews and even add their own games.
